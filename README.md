# Travel Assistant Project
As the impact of COVID-19 recedes, the travel industry is beginning to bottom out. People across the country are starting to plan their holiday travel. When they fly to a city, they need to plan their days in advance to make sure they hit all the attractions they want to visit and some delicious restaurants. Thus, this project was born. I named this project Travel Assistant. The travel assistant is dedicated to helping you optimize your daily travel route so that you can save more time and energy on transportation.
